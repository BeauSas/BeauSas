I'm currently still studying for *IT & Electrical Engineering* degree, but that doesn't stop me from working
 on my many side-projects. My interests are very diverse, and enjoy learning and aquiring new skills.
 Before starting my current studies, I've been studying *game development* in a different independent University.
 I prefer executing and working on my own projects or working in teams for fun competitions & challenges,
   but I'm definately willing to listen for external proposals.
