- 🪶 A quote to describe myself: *“A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.”* - Robert Greene

I'm currently still studying for *IT & Electrical Engineering* degree, but that doesn't stop me from working
 on my many side-projects. My interests are very diverse, and enjoy learning and aquiring new skills.
 Before starting my current studies, I've been studying *game development* in a different independent University.
 I prefer executing and working on my own projects or working in teams for fun competitions & challenges,
   but I'm definately willing to listen for external proposals.

 Sharpening my skills and creating pieces is not limited to coding & electronics. I also have a wide skillset in
 digital arts going from ***photoshop*** to ***editting/videography*** to ***3D-Modelling*** & so on. If you wish to discuss any of these
 matters, please message me. 🙂
